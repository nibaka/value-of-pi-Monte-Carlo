# value-of-pi-Monte-Carlo-MPI
Determining the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method, which is a numerical integral method with MPI

parallel code using MPI:
N is a random point in a square with characteristics x between 1-to 1 and y between 1-to 1 and calculating the value of pi through the following equation :
 Ï€ = 4 n/N
Determining time for N=10^8
